### Projects In the Making

Here are some of the projects that I am working on currently. Lets be honest here, I am probably never going to complete some of them, but hey that's what programming is about, you complete some stuff and some you dont.
- A cross device capable reminder app with android,watchos,ios,linux,windows,macos and web clients(I know thats a lot for just one guy)
- An instagram bot that allows you to execute commands inside your dm. So for example, you can send a message of the new program your making to all your followers by just typing out a quick command and then let the bot to the rest in the backgroud. The entire project will be OPEN SOURCE :) .
